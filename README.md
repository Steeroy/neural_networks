# neural_networks
This is a Machine Learning project that focuses on Neural Networks

## How to operate:
You can download Anaconda software which is able to open jupyter notebooks on the web, or you can also use google colab, but I would advise using Conda as it has all the inbuilt python packages and the ones which we use for the notebook, such as numpy, matplotlib and pandas.
